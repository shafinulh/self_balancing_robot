#StepperController
A custom built library to control the NEMA-17 Stepper Motors for the base of the Self Balancing Robot but can be used in any other Stepper Motor application. 

I chose to create a custom library to learn more about writing the basic controls of robotic systems in C++. I also find enjoyment in developing my own libraries/tools/utilities etc. Writing my own library means I have full control over it, so I can optimize it as I see fit, and I can design it the way I want (ie. syntax/naming conventions that I mentioned earlier). It's been a very rewarding experience so far and it's taught me a lot about how to develop my own libraries. It's also nice having something that I can easily integrate into future projects, as well as the understanding all the code that I write/use.

#Arduino_LSM6DSOX.h
A pre-built library that allows use of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) that is on the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect board.

#MadgwickAHRS
A pre-built library that implements the MadgwickAHRS algorithm to get the angle and orientation of an object based on accelerometer and gyroscope readings.

#MBED_RPI_PICO_TimerInterrupt
A pre-built library to use interrupts from Hardware Timers on the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
